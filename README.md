# Mouse_control_with_Python_Arduino_and_MPU6050
# This is a way to control the mouse poiter and keystrokes in Windows with an arduino (without HID) and using an MPU6050 accelerometer and 
# Python as an interpreter of the arduino signals. My first idea was put the MPU on a hat for control the computer only with the movements
# of my head. I think this could be useful for certain people with some kind of movement restrictions.
